Whiley ZLIB Benchmark, 
============================================================================
Author: David J. Pearce, 2011

This benchmark represents a reimplementation of the well known ZLib
library in Whiley.  This implementation has been written completely
from scratch based on RFC1951 and without reference to any other
existing implementations.  As such the implementation is not intended
to be particularly efficient.  

NOTES: currently, only decompression is implemented.
