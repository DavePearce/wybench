// This implements a simple algorithm for solving the perfect
// matching problem over bipartite graphs.  In essence, the problem is to
// determine whether a matching exists for all vertices in a given
// bipartite graph.  The algorithm is apparently an implementation of
// "Kuhn's algorithm", though I haven't found a reference for that yet.
//
// The algorithm is relatively straightforward and it proceeds by a
// left-to-right traversal of the vertices in the first partition.  For
// each vertex, if it encounters a neighbour which is unmatched, then it
// will greedily match it.  Otherwise, it attempts to reconfigure the
// currently matching by finding an "augmenting path".  Roughly speaking,
// that is a path from the vertex in question which ends in an unmatched
// vertex.
