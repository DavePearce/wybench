/**
 * <p>
 * Implements the battle area in which robots are drawn. This is implement as an
 * extension of java.awt.Canvas, and robots are drawn directly onto this as
 * images. The background is constructed by drawing a sequence of filled squares
 * with different colours.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The battle area uses "interpolation" to give the robots smoother movement
 * from one square to another. The idea behind interpolation is that we plot the
 * line from the current position to the next position and then draw the robot
 * at different positions along that line. This stops the robot from seemingly
 * "jumping" from one location to another.
