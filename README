Wybench
===================================================================

Wybench is a suite of benchmark programs used for testing and
qdemonstrating the Whiley language.  The benchmarks are split into
four categories:

seq/micro/ --- these are a collection of small sequential benchmarks,
               primarily used for performance testing.

seq/macro/ --- these are a collection of larger sequential benchmarks.

par/micro/ --- these are a collection of small parallel benchmarks,
               primarily used for performance testing.

par/macro/ --- these are a collection of larger parallel benchmarks.

(currently, none of the parallel benchmarks are implemented yet)
