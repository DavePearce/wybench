===================================================================

Wybench is a suite of benchmark programs used for testing and
demonstrating the Whiley language.  Here are some details about the
benchmarks:

(micro)

001_average --- Computes the average of a list of integers.

002_fib --- Computes the first 41 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

003_gcd --- Implements Euclid's algorithm for finding the Greatest
            Common Divisor of two numbers.

004_matrix --- Implements the classical Matrix multiplication
               algorithm.

005_paths --- Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the
              single-source shortest paths of a directed graph
              [BROKEN]

006_queens --- Implements a solution for the N-Queens problem.

007_regex --- Implements a simple regular expression matcher.

008_scc --- Implements a variant of Tarjan's algorithm for finding
            strongly connected components.

009_lz77 --- Implements LZ77 compression and decompression.

010_sort* --- Implements a simple merge sort.

011_codejam --- A solution to test A of the Google Code Jam
                Qualificition round in May 2011.

015_cashtill* --- A simple example implementing a cash till which
                  computes the change to given to a customer after a
                  purchase.

(small)

101_calculator --- A simple parser and evaluator for arithmetic
                   expressions.

102_conway --- An implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

103_tetris --- A simple implementation of Tetris.

104_tictactoe* --- A simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe (a.k.a
                  Noughts & Crosses).

(large)

201_convert --- An image convertor which allows files to be converted
                to/from GIF and PNG.  To implement the PNG format, a
                complete implementation of the ZLIB
                compression/decompression standard is provided.

202_chess --- A chess game validitor, which accepts chess games in
              short algebraic notation and checks that they are valid
              according to the rules of chess.

203_jasm --- A Java Bytecode assembler / disassembler.

204_raytrace --- A simple ray tracer [BROKEN]
