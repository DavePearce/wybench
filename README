Wybench
===================================================================

Wybench is a suite of benchmark programs used for testing and
qdemonstrating the Whiley language.  The benchmarks are split into
four categories:

sequential/micro/ --- these are a collection of small sequential benchmarks,
               primarily used for performance testing.

sequential/macro/ --- these are a collection of larger sequential benchmarks.

concurrent/micro/ --- these are a collection of small parallel benchmarks,
               primarily used for performance testing.

concurrent/macro/ --- these are a collection of larger parallel benchmarks.

(currently, none of the parallel benchmarks are implemented yet)
