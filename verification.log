Notes on which benchmarks fail verification and why
===================================================

---------------------------------------------------
Passing:
---------------------------------------------------

002_fib --- OK

006_queens --- OK

007_regex --- OK

022_cars --- OK

023_microwave --- OK

---------------------------------------------------
Failing (for known reason):
---------------------------------------------------

001_average --- Fails because of problem typing generated VCs.
                Specifically, dividing a real by an integer.  See #366

003_gcd --- Fails because lacking correct type information from WyIL
            in the verifier.  See #367

008_scc --- Fails because large VC's generated.  see #365

011_codejam --- Fails because of function overriding (see #347).
                However, doesn't pass after manual workaround because
                (I believe) of quantifier instantiation problem.

013_btree --- Fails because lack of support for recursive types.  See
              #298.

016_date --- Missing Remainder Operator.  See #337

017_math --- Fails because of function overriding (see #347).
	     However, doesn't pass after manual workaround because of
	     problem with verifying foreach loops (see #228).

101_calculator --- Fails because lack of support for recursive types.  See
              #298.

---------------------------------------------------
Failing (for unknown reason):
---------------------------------------------------

004_matrix --- Possibly timeout exception?

009_lz77 --- Possibly timeout exception?

010_sort --- Possibly timeout exception?

012_cyclic --- Possibly timeout exception?

014_lights --- Possibly too many paths for VC generator?

015_cashtill --- mysterious typing error?

102_conway --- mysterious generic binding error?

104_tictactoe --- mysterious ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

107_minesweeper --- mysterious NullPointerException?
