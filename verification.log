Notes on which benchmarks fail verification and why
===================================================

---------------------------------------------------
Passing:
---------------------------------------------------

002_fib --- OK

023_microwave --- OK

006_queens --- OK

007_regex --- OK

---------------------------------------------------
Failing (for known reason):
---------------------------------------------------

001_average --- Fails because of problem typing generated VCs.
                Specifically, dividing a real by an integer.  See #366

003_gcd --- Fails because lacking correct type information from WyIL
            in the verifier.  See #367

008_scc --- Fails because large VC's generated.  see #365

011_codejam --- Fails because of function overriding (see #347).
                However, doesn't pass after manual workaround because
                (I believe) of quantifier instantiation problem.

---------------------------------------------------
Failing (for unknown reason):
---------------------------------------------------

004_matrix --- Possibly timeout exception?

009_lz77 --- Possibly timeout exception?

010_sort --- Possibly timeout exception?

012_cyclic --- Possibly timeout exception?

---------------------------------------------------
Untested:
---------------------------------------------------

013_btree 

014_lights

015_cashtill

016_date

017_math

022_cars
